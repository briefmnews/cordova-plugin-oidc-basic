# Cordova Plugin OpenID Connect (OIDC) Basic

## Dependencies
This plugin aims to be a thin wrapper around the following libraries/APIs:
- iOS -- [AppAuth-iOS](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-iOS)
- Windows -- The [Web Authentication Broker](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/Windows.Security.Authentication.Web.WebAuthenticationBroker) API
- Android -- Android support is pending, but planning to use [AppAuth-Android](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-Android).

## Usage
```js
var req = {
    configuration: {
        authorizationEndpoint: "https://my-authorization-endpoint/authorize"
    },
    clientId: "my-client-id",
    scope: "openid",
    state: "my-state", // or leave absent and the plugin will generate random state by default
    redirectUrl: "my-redirect-url", // see notes on redirectUrl below
    responseType: "code" // authorization code flow
};
// Initiate authorization request
cordova.plugins.oidc.basic.presentAuthorizationRequest(req,
    function (resp) {
        // Success
        // Send following response info to server to perform the token exchange:
        // resp.authorizationCode -- The authorization code
        // resp.request.codeVerifier -- The codeVerifier. Generated by the plugin (currently no option to pass in or disable PKCE). Needed as part of the token request.
        // resp.request.nonce -- The nonce. Generated by the plugin (currently no option to pass in or disable). Needed as part of ID token validation.
    },
    function (err) {
        // Error. Inspect err.oidcType to see what kind. See below for more on errors and error types.
        // Example of handling a specific error type:
        if (err.oidcType === cordova.plugins.oidc.basic.ErrorType.USER_CANCELLED) {
            // User cancelled the authorizationr request
        }
        // Can handle other error types as needed
    }
);
```

## Setup
### Configuring the `redirectUrl`
To successfully receive redirects on all platforms, your `redirectUrl` must adhere to the following conventions:
- For iOS 11+, the `redirectUrl` can be any URL as long as it uses a custom scheme (not http or https). No
preregistration of your `redirectUrl` is required.
- For iOS 10 and below, the `redirectUrl` can be any URL as long as it uses a custom scheme (not http or
https), but you need to declare the scheme in your `*-Info.plist` file. You can use the [Custom-URL-scheme
plugin](https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/Custom-URL-scheme) to do this. See https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/Custom-URL-scheme#2-installation.
- For Windows, the `redirectUrl` can be any URL (or so it seems). No preregistration of your `redirectUrl`
is required.

### Tips on CocoaPods Setup on iOS
The iOS plugin uses [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) to bundle [AppAuth-iOS](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-iOS). If you haven't used CocoaPods before, you may find the following setup steps helpful:
- Download CocoaPods onto your iOS development machine either from https://cocoapods.org/app or by
following the steps at https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html. The first link installs a small GUI application. When it prompts you to install the CLI tool, say yes. The second link installs just
the CLI tool.
- You'll need to clone the CocoaPods Master repo before you perform iOS builds. Follow the steps at
https://stackoverflow.com/a/39904450 to minimize the size of the clone. Be aware that "minimize" is relative:
as of March 2020, a shallow clone still took 1.94GB on my box.
- After you `cordova plugin add` this plugin, it'll create a new `*.xcworkspace` file (e.g. `MyApp.xcworkspace`) next to your existing `*.xcodeproj` file in `.../platforms/ios`. Open the `*.xcworkspace` file
in XCode instead of the `*.xcodeproj` file. If you open just the `*.xcodeproj` file, XCode will fail to
include AppAuth-iOS when you try to build.

## Supported Features
- OpenID Connect authentication requests and OAuth 2.0 authorization requests.
Use `presentAuthorizationRequest`.
Authorization code flow, implicit flow, and OpenID Connect hybrid flow are all supported.
See https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#Authentication
and https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.
- OpenID Connect RP-initiated logout.
Use `presentEndSessionRequest`.
See https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-session-1_0.html#RPLogout.

This plugin does not (and likely will not) provide APIs to perform a token request as part of the
authorization code or hybrid flows or validate the OpenID Connect ID token returned from a token request or
as part of the implicit flow. Since those steps require no user interaction, there's no reason they need
Cordova plugin support. If you're looking to perform those steps in app, consider resources such as
- [AppAuth-JS](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-JS), which supports sending token requests
- [jwt-decode](https://github.com/auth0/jwt-decode), which supports decoding (though not validating) JWT
tokens

Or, if possible, use the authorization code flow and perform your token request and ID token validation
server-side. For a node server, consider resources such as
- [AppAuth-JS](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-JS), which works in Node as well as in browser
- [node-jsonwebtoken](https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken), which supports decoding and validating JWT
tokens



## Concurrent Requests
cordova-plugin-oidc-basic forbids concurrent calls to either `presentAuthorizationRequest` or
`presentEndSessionRequest`. If a call to `presentAuthorizationRequest` or `presentEndSessionRequest` is
already pending, then cordova-plugin-oidc-basic will reject a 2nd call to either method with an error of
type `UNSENDABLE_REQUEST`. This is partly a matter of implementation convenience: On some platforms (e.g.
older iOS), the plugin must manually route incoming callbacks from the OS to pending requests, and that routing is simpler if there can be at most one such request. It also prevents bombarding the user with
multiple concurrent login screens.

## Errors
### Error types
All error types are available via `cordova.plugins.oidc.basic.ErrorType`. Explanation of types:
- `cordova.plugins.oidc.basic.ErrorType.UNSENDABLE_REQUEST` -- The calling code did something wrong,
e.g. passed an invalid authorization request, such that the request couldn't even be sent to the
authorization server.
- `cordova.plugins.oidc.basic.ErrorType.ERROR_RESPONSE` -- The authorization server returned an error
response as specified in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1.2.1.
- `cordova.plugins.oidc.basic.ErrorType.INVALID_RESPONSE` -- The authorization server returned an
invalid response not in keeping w/ the OpenID Connect/OAuth 2.0 spec.
- `cordova.plugins.oidc.basic.ErrorType.HTTP_ERROR` -- There was an HTTP error completing the request.
- `cordova.plugins.oidc.basic.ErrorType.USER_CANCELLED` -- The user cancelled the request.
- `cordova.plugins.oidc.basic.ErrorType.UNEXPECTED_ERROR` -- There was an unexpected error completing
the request.

### Error interface
All errors passed to the provided error callback are normal JS `Error`s extended with the following
properties:
- `oidcType` String. One of the `cordova.plugins.oidc.basic.ErrorType` values.
- `oidcDetails` String. Optional. Additional details about the error.
- `oidcResponse` Object. Optional. If applicable, the error response from the authorization server.
